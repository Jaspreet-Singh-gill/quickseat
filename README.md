I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to my amazing team members for their dedication, creativity, and hard work in the development of QuickSeat. This project would not have been possible without your valuable contributions and collaborative spirit.

Even though the project may not have reached the level we all initially hoped for, it still stands as a significant accomplishmentâ€”a proud first step toward development and AI.
